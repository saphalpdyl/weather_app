    NOTE: This app was made as a fun experiment to prove if having robust concepts but limited language knowledge is
    enough to create a simple app in Django. The day this app was made, it had only been 2 weeks since I had started
    learning django. The app was wrtten without using any sources such as Google, ChatGPT, Bard, W3Schools or any other
    internet resource. Except for the fonts and images, the app was essentially written offline with mock JSON data for 
    testing API. Later, the app was integrated with OpenWeatherAPI. <span>Because of the constraints of not having online help,
    the code written is extremely unconventional and may lead to bugs. Play with caution. ðŸ’–</span>
